# Pi1541-HAT
Just another Pi1541-HAT. Please refer to Steve Whites project page (https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/), who had the idea for the project and develops the software running in the Raspberry Pi.

There are several Pi1541-HATs, which are all good, nevertheless I have decided to make my own HAT. 

1. It has detachable display, switches and IEC-Bus boards

2. There is a barrel connector on the IEC-Bus Board, so no requirement for using the micro USB and no side entry for the enclosure required.

I have made it this way to add flexibility to the HAT when it comes to be installed in an enclose and also alows a lower profile enclosure, since the high IEC-bus jacks are not above HAT level.

As a replacement for the switch board, a pcb with a rotary encoder with push button is being developed. This would add a bit more comfort while navigating through the directories.
